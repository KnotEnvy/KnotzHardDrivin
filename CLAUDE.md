## TL;DR - What You Need to Know in 60 Seconds

This is a browser-based 3D racing game remake of the classic Hard Drivin' arcade game. **Phases 0-5 are COMPLETE and VALIDATED**. **Phase 6 & 7 are IN PROGRESS** with Ghost AI, UI/HUD, and Audio systems built and undergoing testing. The game is fully functional and playable with crash detection, cinematic replays, timer system, and persistent leaderboards.

**Quick Facts**:
- 60fps target, <16.67ms frame budget (currently ~4-5ms - excellent headroom)
- TypeScript strict mode (1 error in GhostRecorder - being fixed)
- **1032 unit tests passing** (92.7%), up from 954 (+78 new tests for Phase 6 & 7)
- E2E playthrough tests validated - game fully playable
- Zero memory leaks, zero per-frame allocations in hot paths
- Fully functional drivable vehicle with realistic physics
- Complete track system with waypoints and lap tracking
- Crash detection, cinematic replay, timer, and leaderboard systems working
- **NEW**: Ghost AI system (Phantom Photon) - built and testing
- **NEW**: Complete UI/HUD system - built and testing
- **NEW**: Audio system with Howler.js - built and testing
- **Game is playable**: http://localhost:4201/ (after `npm run dev`)

**🚨 IMPORTANT - Phase 5 Completion & Validation (Oct 18, 2025)**:
Phase 5 (Timing & Scoring System) is now COMPLETE and E2E VALIDATED:
- ✅ TimerSystem (476 lines) - Race timing, lap tracking, bonuses, penalties
- ✅ LeaderboardSystem (440 lines) - Top 10 persistent leaderboard with ghost data

### Design Patterns

1. **Fixed Timestep Loop** (GameEngine.ts)
   - Physics: Always 60Hz (1/60s = 0.01667s)
   - Rendering: Variable rate
   - Accumulator pattern prevents drift

2. **Finite State Machine** (StateManager.ts)
   - States: LOADING, MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, CRASHED, REPLAY, RESULTS
   - Validated transitions (prevents invalid state changes)

3. **Object Pooling** (ObjectPool.ts)
   - Reuse objects instead of allocating
   - Eliminates GC pauses
   - Critical for particles, projectiles

4. **Zero Per-Frame Allocations**
   - Reuse temp vectors/quaternions
   - Prefer `.copy()` over `.clone()`
   - Return references not new objects

### Performance Budgets (60fps = 16.67ms per frame)

| System | Budget | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Physics | 5ms | ~0.5ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Rendering | 8ms | 3-4ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Game Logic | 2ms | <0.5ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Other | 1.67ms | <0.5ms | ✅ Excellent |
| **TOTAL** | 16.67ms | ~4-5ms | ✅ **12ms headroom** |

## 6. Development Workflow

### Starting Phase 6

1. **Read Phase 6 roadmap**: `__DOCS__\phase6\Phase_6_ROADMAP.md`
2. **Read PRD Section 4.5**: AI Ghost Opponent
3. **Review Phase 5 completion**: `__DOCS__\phase5\PHASE_5_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
4. **Consult technical-architect**: Design review for Ghost Ai architecture
5. **Set up testing**: Work with testing-qa-specialist for test plan
7. **Test after each feature**: >80% coverage required
8. **Profile performance**: UI rendering <2ms per frame
9. **Document**: Update docs as you build

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests (Vitest)**:
- Target: >80% coverage (>90% preferred)
- All 791 current tests must keep passing
- Mock Three.js, Rapier.js, and DOM elements
- Run: `npm test`
- Coverage: `npm test -- --coverage`

**Integration Tests**:
- Test menu → playing → results flow
- Test HUD updates and data binding
- Test settings persistence across sessions
- Test UI state management with GameEngine FSM

**Performance Validation**:
- UI rendering overhead: <2ms per frame
- No layout thrashing or forced reflows
- Smooth 60fps with all UI visible
- Chrome DevTools Performance profiling

### TypeScript Strict Mode

**All code MUST**:
- Pass `npm run type-check` with zero errors
- Use TypeScript strict mode (enabled)
- Minimize `any` types (use proper types or `unknown`)
- Have proper interfaces and type definitions

**Known Technical Debt**:
- Some `any` types exist in codebase (deferred to Phase 7)
- Not blocking, but avoid adding new `any` types

---

## 7. Important Conventions

### Naming Conventions

**Files**:
- PascalCase for classes: `CrashManager.ts`, `ReplayRecorder.ts`
- camelCase for utilities: `mathUtils.ts`
- Test files: `CrashManager.test.ts`

**Code**:
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ReplaySystem`)
- Functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `recordFrame()`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `CRASH_FORCE_THRESHOLD`)
- Private members: prefix `_` or use `private` keyword

### TSDoc Requirements

**All public APIs MUST have TSDoc**:

```typescript
/**
 * Records current vehicle state for replay playback.
 *
 * @param vehicle - Vehicle instance to record
 * @param deltaTime - Time step in seconds
 * @returns Frame data object
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const frame = recorder.recordFrame(vehicle, 0.016);
 * ```
 */
public recordFrame(vehicle: Vehicle, deltaTime: number): FrameData {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### No Emojis in Code

- Do NOT add emojis to code comments
- Do NOT add emojis to console logs
- Do NOT add emojis to documentation
- Exception: If user explicitly requests emojis

### Error Handling

**Always handle errors explicitly**:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD
try {
  await replayRecorder.saveToStorage();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to save replay:', error);
  throw new Error('Replay save failed');
}

// ❌ BAD - Silent failure
try {
  await replayRecorder.saveToStorage();
} catch (error) {
  // Silent - DON'T DO THIS
}
```

---

## 8. Critical Performance Guidelines

### No Per-Frame Allocations

```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Allocates every frame
update(deltaTime: number): void {
  const temp = new Vector3(); // ALLOCATES
}

// ✅ GOOD - Reuse temp vector
private tempVec = new Vector3();
update(deltaTime: number): void {
  this.tempVec.set(0, 0, 0); // REUSES
}
```

### Prefer .copy() Over .clone()

```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Allocates new object
const newPos = oldPos.clone();

// ✅ GOOD - Reuses existing
this.tempVec.copy(oldPos);
```

### Object Pooling for Frequent Allocations

```typescript
import { createVector3Pool } from '@utils/ObjectPool';

const pool = createVector3Pool(100);
const temp = pool.acquire();
// Use it...
pool.release(temp);
```

### Memory Leak Prevention

**Always clean up**:

```typescript
dispose(): void {
  // Remove event listeners
  window.removeEventListener('resize', this.resizeHandler);

  // Dispose Three.js resources
  this.mesh.geometry.dispose();
  this.mesh.material.dispose();

  // Cancel animation frames

## 10. Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Low Priority (Deferred)

1. **Some `any` type usage** (deferred to Phase 7)
   - Location: Various files
   - Impact: Type safety slightly reduced
   - Fix: Replace with proper types during Phase 7 polish

2. **7 E2E test failures** (Playwright config issues)
   - Location: tests/e2e/*.spec.ts
   - Impact: Debug tests, not critical
   - Fix: Phase 8 (Testing & Optimization)

### No Critical Blockers

All critical issues from the completion report review (Oct 17, 2025) have been fixed:
- ✅ TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Test infrastructure complete
- ✅ Per-frame allocations eliminated
- ✅ All unit tests passing

Additional fixes (Oct 22, 2025):
- ✅ Crash detection grace period timing bug resolved
- ✅ Crash thresholds tuned to prevent false positives
- ✅ Track geometry corrected (no longer flying in air)
- ✅ Vehicle model selection working correctly
- ✅ State machine transitions updated for proper flow
- ✅ Debug logging removed for clean production output
