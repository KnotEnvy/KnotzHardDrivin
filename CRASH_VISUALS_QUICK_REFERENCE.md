# Crash Visual Effects - Quick Reference

## What This Does

When the player crashes at high speed, the vehicle chassis visually deforms during the replay to show the impact. After respawn, the vehicle returns to pristine condition.

**Visual Effect**: Vehicle appears crushed/flattened based on damage severity.

## User Experience

```
Crash at high speed
    ↓
Replay starts with visibly crushed vehicle
    ↓
Player watches damage feedback
    ↓
Replay ends, vehicle respawns
    ↓
Vehicle returns to perfect condition
    ↓
Ready for next attempt
```

## Code Integration Points

### 1. Vehicle.applyCrashVisuals()
**Called when**: Crash is detected (in GameEngine.handleCrashReplayTrigger)
**Effect**: Scales chassis mesh to show deformation
**Time**: Instant (<0.1ms)

### 2. Vehicle.resetCrashVisuals()
**Called when**: Vehicle respawns (automatically in Vehicle.reset)
**Effect**: Restores chassis to original appearance
**Time**: Instant (<0.1ms)

## Visual Scaling Formula

```typescript
// Y-axis (height): 0-35% reduction based on damage
heightScale = Math.max(0.65, 1.0 - damage * 0.35)

// Z-axis (length): 0-15% reduction based on damage
lengthScale = Math.max(0.85, 1.0 - damage * 0.15)

// Rotation: Random tilt for asymmetry
rotationZ = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1  // ±5.7°
rotationX = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.08 // ±4.6°
```

## Damage Level Examples

| Scenario | Damage | Height | Appearance |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| Minor crash into cone | 10% | 96.5% | Barely visible damage |
| Moderate crash into wall | 40% | 86% | Noticeably crushed |
| High-speed collision | 60% | 79% | Heavily deformed |
| Catastrophic impact | 90% | 68.5% | Severely crushed |

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| applyCrashVisuals() time | <0.1ms |
| resetCrashVisuals() time | <0.1ms |
| Memory per vehicle | 13 bytes |
| Per-frame cost | 0ms |
| Allocations per crash | 1 (first crash only) |

## Key Files

| File | What Changed | Lines |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `src/entities/Vehicle.ts` | Added visual damage system | 108-110, 440-441, 444-546 |
| `src/core/GameEngine.ts` | Trigger crash visuals | 277-282 |
| `tests/unit/Vehicle.test.ts` | Unit test coverage | 329-429 |

## How to Use (as Developer)

### Manual Testing

1. Start game: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:4201
3. Drive vehicle normally
4. Crash at high speed (>50mph) into obstacle
5. Watch replay - vehicle should appear crushed
6. After replay, vehicle should appear pristine

### Checking the Code

```typescript
// Vehicle.ts - Apply damage
vehicle.applyCrashVisuals();
// Scales Y by (1.0 - damage * 0.35)
// Scales Z by (1.0 - damage * 0.15)

// Vehicle.ts - Reset
vehicle.resetCrashVisuals();
// Restores original scale
// Clears rotation
```

### Modifying Deformation

Edit `Vehicle.ts` lines 485-495:

```typescript
// Line 485: Damage scaling formula
const heightScale = Math.max(0.65, 1.0 - damageAmount * 0.35);

// Line 490: Z-axis scaling
this.chassisMesh.scale.z = Math.max(0.85, 1.0 - damageAmount * 0.15);

// Lines 494-495: Rotation tilt
this.chassisMesh.rotation.z = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1;
this.chassisMesh.rotation.x = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.08;
```

## Crash Severity Thresholds

| Severity | Force | Damage | Visual Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| None | <25kN | 0% | Normal |
| Minor | 25-50kN | 5-20% | Slight crush |
| Major | 50-75kN | 20-50% | Obvious crush |
| Catastrophic | >75kN | 50-100% | Heavy deformation |

## Edge Cases Handled

- ✓ Calling applyCrashVisuals() twice (idempotent)
- ✓ Calling resetCrashVisuals() without applying first (safe)
- ✓ Vehicle not initialized yet (returns early)
- ✓ No mesh available (returns early)
- ✓ Rapid state changes (all safe)

## Physics Notes

**Important**: This only affects visual mesh:
- Does NOT modify Rapier physics body
- Does NOT affect collision geometry
- Does NOT impact vehicle dynamics
- Safe to use during replay (no physics interference)

## Debugging

### Check if Visuals Applied
```typescript
// Vehicle should log:
// "Applied crash visuals: damage=60.0%, height scale=79.0%"
```

### Check if Visuals Reset
```typescript
// Vehicle should log:
// "Reset crash visuals: vehicle restored to pristine appearance"
```

### Verify in Chrome DevTools
1. F12 → Performance → Record
2. Cause crash and replay
3. Search for "applyCrashVisuals" in timeline
4. Should show <0.1ms spike
5. No memory allocations in recording

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (Phase 8+):
- Add dust/debris particles on impact
- Add damage cracks to texture
- Add crushing sound effect
- Add smoke trail during replay
- Make deformation formula configurable
- Per-impact-location deformation
- Progressive damage accumulation
