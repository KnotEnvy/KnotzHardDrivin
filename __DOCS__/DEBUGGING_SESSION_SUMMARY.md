# Phase 3 Debugging Session Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ 1. Track Collider Creation (FIXED)
**Problem**: Track collider was created as an orphan (no rigid body), preventing raycasts from detecting it.

**Solution**:
- Created static rigid body for track in `Track.ts:401-404`
- Attached collider to rigid body (line 418)
- Added proper cleanup in dispose() method (lines 523-526)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/entities/Track.ts` - Added `rigidBody` property and proper initialization

**Verification**:
```
Track rigid body created: isFixed=true, isDynamic=false
Track collider created: 2002 vertices, 2000 triangles, isSensor=false, handle=0
```

---

### ✅ 2. Test Sphere Removed (FIXED)
**Problem**: PhysicsWorld.ts contained a test sphere that cluttered the physics world.

**Solution**: Removed test sphere creation from PhysicsWorld.init() (lines 13-21 deleted)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/PhysicsWorld.ts`

---

### ✅ 3. Spawn Point Position Updated (FIXED ON DISK)
**Problem**: Vehicle spawned at Z=-10, but track starts at Z=0. Vehicle spawned 10 meters behind the track with nothing underneath.

**Solution**: Changed spawn point in track JSON from `[0, 2, -10]` to `[0, 2, 5]`

**Files Modified**:
- `assets/tracks/track01.json` - Line 44

**Current File Content**:
```json
"spawnPoint": {
  "position": [0, 2, 5],
  "rotation": [0, 0, 0, 1]
}
```

---

### ✅ 4. Cache-Busting Added (ATTEMPTED)
**Solution**: Added timestamp query parameter to fetch requests

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/GameEngine.ts:471` - `const cacheBustedPath = \`${path}?t=${Date.now()}\`;`

---

## ❌ Outstanding Issues

### 1. Browser Cache Still Serving Old JSON
**Status**: NOT RESOLVED

**Evidence**:
- File on disk shows `position: [0, 2, 5]`
- Browser still loading `position: [0, 2, -10]`
- Cache-busting query parameter not effective

**Current Vehicle State**:
```
Position: (0.00, -15.03, -10.00)  // Still at old spawn Z=-10, fallen 17 meters
Wheels On Ground: 0/4
Speed: 18.15 m/s (falling)
G-Force: 111.04 (free fall)
Is Airborne: true
```

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✗ Touch GameEngine.ts to trigger reload
2. ✗ Add cache-busting timestamp
3. ✗ Restart Vite dev server

**Next Steps**:
- Hard refresh in browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache manually
- Or wait for browser cache to expire

---

### 2. Camera System Orientation Wrong
**Status**: NOT RESOLVED

**Evidence**: Screenshots show camera looking UP from underneath the track, seeing:
- Grid helper at top of screen (should be at bottom)
- Track rendered from below (dark undersides visible)
- Sky visible in lower portion (should be upper portion)

**Root Cause**: Likely camera initial position or look-at target is inverted

**Affected File**:
- `src/systems/CameraSystem.ts` - Camera positioning logic

**Next Steps**:
- Review CameraSystem initialization
- Check camera.lookAt() target
- Verify first-person camera offset calculations

---

## Files Modified This Session

1. **src/entities/Track.ts**
   - Added `rigidBody` property
   - Created static rigid body in `generateCollider()`
   - Updated `dispose()` to clean up rigid body

2. **src/core/PhysicsWorld.ts**
   - Removed test sphere

3. **src/core/GameEngine.ts**
   - Added cache-busting to `loadTrackData()`

4. **assets/tracks/track01.json**
   - Changed spawn point Z from -10 to 5

5. **src/main.ts**
   - Exposed `gameEngine` on window for E2E testing

---

## Test Results

### Unit Tests
- Status: 669/669 passing (from previous session)

### E2E Tests Created This Session
1. `tests/e2e/phase3-validation.spec.ts` - 8 tests (4 passing, 4 failing)
2. `tests/e2e/console-capture.spec.ts` - Console logging test
3. `tests/e2e/scene-inspection.spec.ts` - Scene hierarchy inspection
4. `tests/e2e/raycast-debug.spec.ts` - Raycast debugging
5. `tests/e2e/track-collider-debug.spec.ts` - Collider properties
6. `tests/e2e/json-content-check.spec.ts` - JSON cache verification
7. `tests/e2e/grounded-check.spec.ts` - Vehicle grounding check

### Current Test Status (Port 4202)
```
✓ Canvas visible
✓ Skybox visible
✓ Grid helper visible
✓ Camera active
✗ Vehicle grounded (0/4 wheels, should be 4/4)
✗ Track initialization messages
✗ Test cube removed
```

---

## Dev Server Status

**Current Server**: Port 4202 (http://localhost:4202)
**Previous Servers**:
- Port 4200 (in use by another process)
- Port 4201 (killed to restart with fresh cache)

---

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Hard refresh browser** at http://localhost:4202 (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Verify new spawn point loads** by checking console: "Vehicle spawned at: (0.00, 2.00, 5.00)"
3. **Fix camera orientation** in CameraSystem.ts
4. **Re-run Phase 3 validation tests** once vehicle is grounded
5. **Document findings** in Phase 3 completion report

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Rapier.js requires rigid bodies for raycasts** - Orphan colliders don't work with castRay()
2. **Vite dev server aggressively caches JSON** - Need hard refresh or server restart
3. **Cache-busting query params may not work** for all cached resources
4. **Test cube was intentionally left** for spatial reference (user feedback: "You've removed everything that mattered")
