 6 - 11 Stars (25-49%) → ADVANCED
                          "Improving driver"

12 - 17 Stars (50-74%) → EXPERT

                          "Perfect mastery"

========================================

COMPLETION CALCULATION

Completion % = (Track Progress × 50%) + (Star Progress × 50%)

Example:
- 4 tracks completed (50% of 8) = 25%
- 8 stars earned (33% of 24) = 16.5%
- Total Completion = 41.5%

========================================

STAR THRESHOLD DESIGN

Formula Applied:
┌──────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
│ Bronze   │ Gold Time × 1.5 (+50%)      │
│ Silver   │ Gold Time × 1.2 (+20%)      │
│ Gold     │ Target Time (mastery)       │
└──────────┴─────────────────────────────┘

Balancing:
• Bronze: Forgiving, ensures progression
• Silver: Solid performance required
• Gold: Near-perfect run, mastery

========================================
