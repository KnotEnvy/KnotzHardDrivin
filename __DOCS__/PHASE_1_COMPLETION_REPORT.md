4. ✅ Three.js resources - fully disposed

**Leak Testing**: 5-minute test with stable heap size (±2MB variance)

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### Performance Issues (All Fixed)

#### Issue 1: Memory Leak - SceneManager ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Window resize listener not cleaned up
**Impact**: Memory leak if SceneManager recreated
**Fix**: Store bound handler reference, cleanup in dispose()
**Status**: ✅ Complete (lines 34, 67-68, 277)

#### Issue 2: Memory Leak - PerformanceMonitor ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: FPS display RAF loop runs indefinitely
**Impact**: Wastes CPU if display removed
**Fix**: Track RAF ID, add stopFPSDisplay() method
**Status**: ✅ Complete (lines 49, 377-385)

#### Issue 3: Per-Frame Allocations - CameraSystem ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple `.clone()` calls creating objects every frame
**Impact**: ~5-10 allocations/frame = GC pressure
**Fix**: Reuse temp vectors, use `.copy()` instead of `.clone()`
**Status**: ✅ Complete (all methods optimized)

#### Issue 4: Missing ObjectPool Infrastructure ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: No pooling system for future particle/projectile systems
**Impact**: Future phases would have allocation issues
**Fix**: Created comprehensive ObjectPool utility
**Status**: ✅ Complete (ObjectPool.ts created)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Fixed timestep architecture** - Rock solid foundation
2. **Parallel development** - 1A and 1B worked well in parallel
3. **Specialized agents** - Each agent delivered excellent results in their domain
4. **Testing first** - Unit tests caught issues early
5. **Performance focus** - Proactive optimization prevented technical debt

### Areas for Improvement 💡
1. **Initial ObjectPool creation** - Should have been in roadmap
2. **Test coverage target** - Could aim for 90%+ coverage in future phases

### Recommendations for Phase 2
1. ✅ Use ObjectPool for any particle systems
2. ✅ Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
3. ✅ Profile early and often (every 2-3 days)
4. ✅ Keep memory leak testing in CI/CD
5. ✅ Maintain current performance standards
