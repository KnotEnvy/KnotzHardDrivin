## Test Execution Instructions

### Running the Test Suite

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd D:\JavaScript Games\KnotzHardDrivin

# Start dev server (if not already running)
npm run dev &

# Wait 15 seconds for server to start
sleep 15

# Run E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/phase5-playthrough.spec.ts --reporter=html

# View HTML report
# Report will be in: ./playwright-report/index.html
```

### Expected Results (After Corrections)

```
Running 27 tests using 1 worker

✅ All 27 tests should pass
⏱️  Duration: ~6-7 minutes
📊 Coverage: All critical game systems
📈 Performance: No regressions
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Tests timeout
- **Solution**: Increase test timeout to 60s or more
- **Command**: `test.setTimeout(60000);`

**Issue**: Cannot find canvas element
- **Solution**: Verify dev server running on localhost:4201
- **Check**: `curl http://localhost:4201`

**Issue**: Game API undefined
- **Solution**: Wait 3+ seconds for GameEngine initialization
- **Fix**: Increase `await page.waitForTimeout(3000)`
