## Coverage Analysis

### Phase 1 Components (Target: 80%+ coverage)

| Component | Statement | Branch | Function | Target Met |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|------------|
| StateManager | 96.7% | 94.44% | 100% | ✅ YES |
| PerformanceMonitor | 97.72% | 94.73% | 100% | ✅ YES |
| CameraSystem | 96.89% | 97.77% | 90% | ✅ YES |
| GameEngine | 69.14% | 97.22% | 66.66% | ⚠️ PARTIAL* |

**Note:** GameEngine coverage is limited by:
- Complex Three.js/Rapier.js dependencies (mocked for testing)
- Game loop testing requires integration tests
- Visibility API limitations in JSDOM
- Core logic and state management well-covered (97.22% branch coverage)

### Overall Project Coverage
- **All files:** 40.46% (expected - many Phase 2+ components not yet implemented)
- **Phase 1 Core:** 55.85%
- **Phase 1 Systems:** 94.44%
- **Phase 1 Utils:** 95.55%
